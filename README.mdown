Features
========

Provides a simple view for drawing a single swatch of colour.

There are many other color well/swatch implementations available, but all that I've come across are bundled as part of a color picker, or other broader component. This one is deliberately isolated.

Drawing is implemented entirely using a `CGShapeLayer`, which should allow Core Image to render more efficiently than when using `-drawRect:` or similar.

`KSWColorWell` will display correctly as part of a `UITableViewCell`, taking on the requested background color as appropriate.

Contact
=======

I'm Mike Abdullah, of [Karelia Software](http://karelia.com). [@mikeabdullah](http://twitter.com/mikeabdullah) on Twitter.

Questions about the code should be left as issues at https://github.com/karelia/KSError or message me on Twitter. I'm interested in any customisation features people may be after.

Dependencies
============

None beyond UIKit.

Requires iOS 7, but only for the `CGPathCreateWithRoundedRect` function. It could be easily replaced with something compatible back to iOS 2 if desired.
